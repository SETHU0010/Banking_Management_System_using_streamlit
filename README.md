This is a simple Banking Management System built with Streamlit and MySQL. The application allows you to create users, view users, deposit money, and withdraw money.

## Overview

The Banking Management System (BMS) is a web application designed to simulate basic banking operations. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing user accounts and processing financial transactions such as deposits and withdrawals.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python 3.x
- **Web Framework**: Streamlit
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Database Connector**: mysql-connector-python

## Domain

- **Financial Technology (FinTech)**
- **Banking Operations**

## Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to create a simple, efficient, and user-friendly banking management system that can:
- Allow users to create accounts with an initial balance.
- Enable users to deposit money into their accounts.
- Enable users to withdraw money from their accounts.
- Display a list of all users with their current balances.

## Approach

1. **Database Design**:
   - **Users Table**: Stores user information such as name, email, and balance.
   - **Transactions Table**: Records all transactions (deposits and withdrawals) for audit purposes.
  
2. **Backend Development**:
   - Establish a connection to the MySQL database.
   - Implement functions to create users, get user details, add transactions, and update user balances.

3. **Frontend Development**:
   - Use Streamlit to create a web interface for interacting with the backend functions.
   - Provide menu options for creating users, viewing users, making deposits, and making withdrawals.

## Results

- A functional web application that can perform basic banking operations.
- User accounts can be created with an initial balance.
